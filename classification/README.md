# Heart Disease Data Analysis
### About Dataset
The dataset consists of 13 columns. Age, gender, cholesterol etc. by analyzing many more values, the heart disease result is determined as 1 or 0 in the target column.
<br>The dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset?select=heart.csv)

### Algorithms and Techniques Used
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines
- GridSearchCV
- Naive Bayes
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Neural Networks

### Power BI Visualizations
The visual includes various graphs and slicers in the Power BI report created for the heart disease dataset. This report examines heart disease rates by variables such as age, gender, and chest pain type,etc. and filters based on selected data in the slicer, making it easier to understand the dataset. <br> <br>
